    Today, Zigzag told me that he make a nice shell command using ruby named NP. He especially recommended me to use this NP tool.
    Now, I get the NP ruby code and run it with command[ruby np "My Today Blog"]. Then I can find a file in the _post directory named with date and extention name textile. And I only need do is write straight matter of the Blog in generated blog file. I needn't care title and date. Because the String parameter of np "My Today Blog" is the title of blog and date is when the "ruby np" command executed.
